# Project13-InstaFilter
Project 13 from 100DaysOfSwift using CoreImage
This App loads an image from the user's gallery using UIImagePickerController and has 11 possible filters to use.

I used CoreImage to load the filters, and the user can play with different intensities of each filter sliding the bar under the image. 

There’s also a button “Clear Filter” so the user can undo the modifications.
